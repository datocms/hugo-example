It is an adaptation of the BBC series of the same name. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.\n\nThe first season of The Office was met with mixed reviews, but the following four seasons received widespread acclaim from television critics, and were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards including four Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series in 2006. While later seasons were criticized for a decline in quality, earlier writers oversaw the final season and ended the show's run with a positive reception."
