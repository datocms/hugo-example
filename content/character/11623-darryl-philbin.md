Darryl is the warehouse foreman and views his job as more difficult and dangerous than the office workers. As warehouse manager, he is concerned with safety and making sure orders get out on time and sees Michael’s antics as the biggest obstacle to those two things. In “Boys and Girls” Michael nearly destroys the warehouse and leaves Darryl to clean it up.

In “Safety Training” Darryl loses his patience with Michael during a safety demonstration because Michael disregards rules and safety, but he gets along with most everyone except Michael. He and Jim are close and he bonds with Toby since they are both single parents.

Darryl gets promoted in “St. Patrick’s Day” and takes a position in the office and then struggles to relate to his former blue-collar workers but shows business savvy and he goes into business with Jim late in the series. He is just a cool and calm dude who enjoys playing the keyboard.
