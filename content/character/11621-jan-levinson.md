Jan beings the show as Michael’s direct supervisor. It is clear from the beginning that she has little patience for him. The two impulsively kiss after Michael impresses her with his sales skills in “The Client.” Jan views this as a mistake but Michael begins calling her his girlfriend.

Their kiss leads Jan down a self-destructive path. She begins smoking and sees a therapist before she gives in to her feelings and begins dating Michael and later moving in with him. She mistreats him in public and private, even breaking his precious plasma TV, and is prone to extreme behavior.

In “Cocktails” she asks Michael to passionately throw her against a wall while making out in David Wallace’s home. In “Women’s Appreciation” Michael reveals to the women in the office that Jan likes to video take their love-making only to watch it after to improve his form.
