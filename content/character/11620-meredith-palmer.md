Meredith Palmer is the promiscuous Supplier Relations Manager. She has been divorced twice and has two kids. She is an alcoholic and often comes to work hung over, complaining that people talk too loudly in the morning and the lights are too bright. In “Business Ethics” she reveals she’s been sleeping with a paper supplier rep to get better pricing and she had a sex pact with a former co-worker.

She isn’t shy when it comes to Jim and has no regard for tact in “Launch Party” when she wants him to sign her pelvic cast, making Jim visible uncomfortable when she lifts up her clothes to reveal the cast.

Meredith has a son, Jake, who was first seen in “Take Your Daughter to Work” and who eventually grows up to be a stripper. Her alcoholism gets the better of her in “Moroccan Christmas” when she drunkenly set her hair on fire prompting Michael to stage an intervention.
