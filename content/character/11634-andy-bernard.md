Andy moved to Pennsylvania to work for Dunder Mifflin Scranton after the Stamford branch closed. He immediately begins sucking up to Michael much to the annoyance of his new co-workers.

He comes across as a rich, spoiled, entitled frat boy type who never passed up a chance to brag about his Alma Mater, Cornell. But the “Nard Dog” has a temper which results in Michael sending him to anger management in “The Return” but he never lets it interrupt his a capella practice.

Due to his insecurity, he often displays selfish and arrogant behavior. He develops a few romantic rivalries with his co-workers including Dwight and Gabe. He duals Dwight over Angela which results in both breaking ties with her.

Andy general irritates his co-workers and tends to overestimate his relationships with others so much so that Michael takes to hiding in his office to avoid him. Most of Andy’s problems come from just wanting to be liked by those around him.
