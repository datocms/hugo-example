Gabe Lewis takes over as Michael’s supervisor in “Sabre” where Dunder Mifflin was bought out by a printer manufacturer. Even though his is a corporate employee, he has no real power in the Scranton branch. The Dunder Mifflin employees know they don’t have to listen to him and don’t respect him.

He works directly for Sabre CEO Jo Bennett and seems to have given up hope of ever having a normal life due to the long hours and frequent travel Jo demands of him.

In “St. Patrick’s Day” he mentions that he goes to Amsterdam seven times a year, presumably to take advantage of legalized drugs and prostitution. He does start a relationship with Erin but she only agrees to go out with him out of obligation because he is her boss. Jo doesn’t doesn’t treat Gabe well either, making him walk her dogs, which further contributes to his lack of self-worth.
