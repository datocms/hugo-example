Karen Filippelli transferred to Scranton from the Stamford branch in the Season 3 episode “The Merger.” She begins a relationship with Jim much to the dismay of Pam who also has feelings for him. Pam initially acts cold to Karen because of this but starts to feel sorry for her in “Benihana Christmas” after Angela banishes Karen from the Party Planning Committee.

Much like Pam, Karen is a target of unwanted attention from the men in the office including Kevin, Michael and Ryan. The end of Season 3 saw the end of her relationship with Karen when Jim dumps her to see if there’s something there with Pam.

Karen leaves the Scranton branch to become the Regional Manager of the Dunder Mifflin Utica branch where she tries to woo Stanley to come work for her and Michael, Dwight and Jim dress up in disguise to prank her.

Despite her previous relationship with Jim, she is genuinely happy to hear the he and Pam are engaged and she’s pregnant so it’s clear she’s moved on too. She doesn’t hide her feelings for Michael, however, who she refers to as an idiot in “Branch Wars.”
