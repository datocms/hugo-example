Explaining why Michael is the best character on the office is like explaining why you need more than just snakes and sparklers for your firework stand. Giving Michael Scott his own personal camera crew must have been his dream come true.

Michael lived to entertain, from hosting the Dundies, to creating not so helpful orientation videos. Michael treated every day of work at Dunder Mifflin as a gift and opportunity to entertain and be loved by his employees. In the end it worked for him when he started a life with Holly in Colorado.

 

Everyone was sad to see Michael leave but remember him for the times they made them smile. He was the heart of the show for seven years and nothing was quite the same after he left. Michael’s best moments range from the ridiculous, like cooking his foot on a George Foreman Grill to incredibly heartfelt like his talk with Jim on the booze cruise about never giving up.

There are so many reasons why Michael was the best which was why this entry was so hard….that’s what she said.
