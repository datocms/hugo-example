Todd Packer is an Outside Sales Rep for the Scranton branch. He is crass, rude and loves to tell inappropriate jokes, so Michael idolizes him for his bold sense of humor. Michael is the only Scranton employee who can stand him.

In “The Carpet” Michael punishes the whole office when he find that someone treated his office like a toilet, but when it is later revealed that Packer is the culprit, Michael views it as a hilarious prank.

Packer also has a bit of a problem with booze. In “Sexual Harassment” Todd asks to have someone drive him around due to “the DUI situation.” In “St. Patrick’s Day” he drunkenly calls Michael from a bar. And in “Christmas Party” he passes out while the Scranton employees cover his head with silly string.
