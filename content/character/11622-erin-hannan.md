Erin takes over the receptionist position after Pam leaves to join the Michael Scott Paper Company. She is cheerful and friendly with every in the office. She considers Pam to be a living legend and looks up to her. Dwight and Andy initially compete to see who she’ll like most.

Erin was introduced halfway through the shows run but has dated more people in the office than anyone else. She dates Andy for a short time before Gabe asks her out.

In Season 9 she starts to date the new employee Pete. As a child Erin suffered many medical issues. She states in “St. Patrick’s Day” that she was hospitalized from age 3 to age 6. Despite her issues and lack of social norms, she is always optimistic and cheerful and generally glad to be working at Dunder Mifflin.
